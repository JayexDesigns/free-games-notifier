# Free Games Notifier
An app I made for windows to get notified when there is a new free game available

# User Use
For normal user use, you only have to execute the main.exe file and it will appear an interface showing the start button, the last 5 free games available, a button to show all the games and an update button. The startup checkbox has no use for now as it's a work in progress functionality.

# For Developers
To anyone who wants to see the code, I have to warn you that I made this a long time ago and that not only I didn't know how to do things properly but also some libraries are not currently working such as win10toast.
