# Free Games Notifier (Currently Not Working)
An app I made for windows to get notified when there is a new free game available

# User Use
~~For a normal user use you only have to execute the main.exe file and it will appear an interface showing the start button, the last 5 free games available and a button to show all the games and an update button. The startup checkbox has no use for now as it's a work in progress functionality.~~

# For Developers
To anyone who wants to see the code I have to warn you that I made this a long time ago and that not only I didn't know how to do things properly but also there are some libraries that are not currently working such as win10toast.
